Docker containers share the same ressources (CPU + Memory) with the host 

Their is no limit in how much ressources containers can use in the host

#Limits to 50% the usage of CPU by a container
docker run --cpus-.5 ubuntu

#Limits to 100M the amount of memory used by a container
docker run --memory=100m ubuntu

#See PID of a container
docker exec conatiner_id ps -eaf
